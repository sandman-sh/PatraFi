# Hello Bridge

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial implements a simplified one-way bridge using Attestcoin readability. Tutorials implementing a full two-way bridge using both readability and writability will be added soon, after the writability core code passes 3rd party audit.

This tutorial introduces you to one of the most common uses for a cross chain oracle, **cross chain
bridging!** The flow is:

1. **Burn** tokens on the source chain (Sepolia).
2. **Submit proof + mint** on Creditcoin — steps 2 and 3 are combined in `yarn hello_bridge:submit_query` (proof generation, attestation wait, and `ASCMinter.execute`). The pre-deployed ASC already has the Sepolia burner registered via `wrapOriginToken`; only burns from that contract mint.

## Pre-deployed contracts (no deploy step)

Hello Bridge uses **shared tutorial contracts** already deployed on CC3 Testnet and Sepolia. The /bridge [`.env.example`](../.env.example) includes pre-filled values for several contracts. Just copy the example env using:

```sh
cp bridge/.env.example bridge/.env
```

Then you only need to add **`CREDITCOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`** and **`SOURCE_CHAIN_RPC_URL`** (Infura Sepolia), then run:

```sh
source bridge/.env
yarn utils:check_setup hello
```

If all checks pass, continue with [Setup](#1-setup) below.

## 0. Install

For our tutorial scripts to function properly, we need to install dependencies first.

```bash
yarn install
```

## 1. Setup

This tutorial involves the use of two different blockchains.

- Sepolia, which serves as our _source chain_ for the tutorial. This is where tokens are burned.
- Creditcoin CC3 Testnet, which serves as our _execution chain_ for the tutorial. This is where our minter Attestcoin smart contract lives. Tokens are minted by that contract.

In order to use both blockchains we need to create a wallet and fund it with the native tokens of
both networks.

### 1.1 Generate a New Wallet Address

In order to safely sign transactions for this tutorial, we want to generate a fresh EVM wallet address.
Since all EVM networks use the same address and transaction signature scheme we can use the address we
create on both Sepolia and Creditcoin CC3 Testnet.

> [!CAUTION]
> In this tutorial, we will be using your wallet's private key to allow some test scripts to act on
> your wallet's behalf. Make sure the wallet you use contains nothing of value. Ideally it should be
> a newly created address.

Generating our new wallet is simple! Just run the following command:

```bash
cast wallet new
```

Save the resulting wallet address and private key for future use. They should look like:

```bash
Address:     0xBE7959cA1b19e159D8C0649860793dDcd125a2D5
Private key: 0xb9c179ed56514accb60c23a862194fa2a6db8bdeb815d16e2c21aa4d7dc2845d # betterleaks:allow
```

```env
CREDITCOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
```

And load into your terminal session with:

```sh
source bridge/.env
```

### 1.2 Get some test funds (`Sepolia`)

Now that you have your new test address ready, you will be needing some funds to make transactions.
You can request some Sepolia ETH tokens using a [🚰 testnet faucet]. We link to the Google sepolia
faucet here.

### 1.3 Get some test funds (`Creditcoin`)

You will also need to fund your account on the Creditcoin CC3 Testnet, otherwise our oracle query
submission will fail due to lack of funds. Head to the [🚰 creditcoin discord faucet] to request
some test tokens there.

Your request for tokens in the Discord faucet should look like this. Substitute in your testnet
account address from [step 1.1]:

```bash
/faucet address: 0xBE7959cA1b19e159D8C0649860793dDcd125a2D5
```

Note, that currently the faucet yields 100 test CTC every 24 hours. That is far more than these
tutorials need: submitting an oracle query costs only gas, on the order of 0.000197 CTC per query.

Now that your wallet is ready to make transactions on both networks, you will be needing a way
to interact with it from the command line.

### 1.4 Obtaining an Infura API key

Finally, you will need a way to send requests to the Sepolia test chain. The easiest way to do this
is to sign up with an _RPC provider_. [Infura] will work for testing purposes.

Follow the onscreen instructions to create your account and generate your first api key. Make sure
you are requesting a Sepolia API key. Copy it: you will be needing it in the following steps. You
are now ready to go with the rest of the tutorial!

Once you have your key edit the following variable in the `.env` file located at the root of this repository.

```env
SOURCE_CHAIN_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<your_infura_api_key>"
```

And load into your terminal session with:

```sh
source bridge/.env
```

## 2. Minting some tokens on Sepolia

More tokens? But I thought I had all the tokens I needed! Well, kind of. For our example we
demonstrate burning ERC20 tokens rather than sepolia native tokens. Making an ERC20 contract call
to burn tokens and emitting a token burn event better demonstrates the best practice way of using
the Creditcoin Oracle described in our [DApp Design Patterns] Gitbook page.

But your new Sepolia account doesn't have these tokens yet!

For your convenience, we have already deployed a test `ERC20` contract to Sepolia which you can
use to mint some dummy ERC20 tokens. Run the following command:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url $SOURCE_CHAIN_RPC_URL \
    $SOURCE_CHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    "mint(uint256)" 50000000000000000000 \
    --private-key $CREDITCOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## 3. Burning the tokens you want to bridge

The first step in bridging tokens is to burn them on the _source chain_ (Sepolia in this case). We
burn tokens by transferring them to an address for which the private key is unknown, making them
inaccessible. This way, when creating the same amount of tokens on Creditcoin at the end of the
bridging process, we won't be creating any artificial value. Run the following command:

```sh
cast send --rpc-url $SOURCE_CHAIN_RPC_URL \
    $SOURCE_CHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    "burn(uint256)" 50000000000000000000 \
    --private-key $CREDITCOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
```

This should display some output stating that your transaction was a success, along with a
transaction hash:

```bash
transactionHash         0xbc1aefc42f7bc5897e7693e815831729dc401877df182b137ab3bf06edeaf0e1
```

Save the transaction hash. You will be needing it in the next step.

## 4. Submit a mint query to the ASC contract

Great, we've burned some tokens! But how can we prove it? Most cross-chain bridges rely on a
_centralized_, _trusted_ approach: one service or company handles all the token burns on the _source
chain_ and is responsible for distributing the same amount of tokens on the target chain. This can
be an issue, since nothing is preventing that company from censoring certain transactions or even
stealing funds! Web3 was made to be _trustless_ and _decentralized_, let's make it that way 😎.

Now that we've burnt funds on Sepolia, we can use that transaction to request a mint in our ASC contract.
But before we can submit our ASC call, we need to generate proofs which will be submitted to the Creditcoin
Oracle to verify our cross-chain data.

All these steps are condensed in the `hello_bridge:submit_query` script, which is run as follows:

```sh
yarn hello_bridge:submit_query <transaction_hash_from_step_3>
```

On a succesfull query, you should see some messages like the following from the script:

```sh
Transaction 0xce785c35e300d607d83da9564990c4d2aaf45dafc68ef76539d97aee3de6859b found in block 11073054

```

With a comparatively slow source chain such as Ethereum or Sepolia, transactions in very recent blocks will take ~8-10 minutes to be attested. This delay is necessary to keep the ASC protocol secure in the event of a **source chain reversion**.

Once that's done we only need to check our newly minted tokens!

## 5. Verify Your Bridged Tokens

As a final check, verify that your tokens were successfully minted on Creditcoin Testnet. You can check your balance using:

```bash
WALLET_ADDRESS=$(cast wallet address --private-key $CREDITCOIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY)
yarn utils:check_balance $ASC_MINTABLE_TOKEN $WALLET_ADDRESS
```

This will return your balance in whole (BTKT) token units.

The contract address and your wallet address should show your minted BTKT tokens from the bridging process.

It should show something like this:

```bash
🔗 Using RPC URL: https://rpc.cc3-testnet.creditcoin.network
📦 Token: Bridge Test Token (BTKT)
🧾 Raw Balance: 50000000000000000000
💰 Formatted Balance: 50.0 BTKT
Decimals for token micro unit: 18
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've bridged your first funds using the **Creditcoin Decentralized oracle!** This
is only a simple example of the cross chain functionality made possible by Creditcoin, keep on
reading to find more ways in which you can leverage decentralized cross-chain proofs of state!

In the next tutorial: [Custom Contracts Bridging], we will be looking at the next piece in the puzzle of decentralized bridging:
self-hosted smart contracts! In a production environment, the Creditcoin oracle will almost always
be used by teams of DApp builders who will handle data provisioning on behalf of their end users.
